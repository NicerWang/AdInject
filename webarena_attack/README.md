# AdInject For VisualWebArena

## Install

Step1. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Step2. config VisualWebArena follow https://github.com/ServiceNow/BrowserGym/blob/main/browsergym/visualwebarena/README.md, and then change all `/path/to/webarena-setup` to real path

Step3. edit code follow [CORE CHANGE](#core-change)

Step4. fill API base url & keys


## Usage

All the tasks we use are in `simple_task_72.json`.

Run `batch_run_*.sh` to start main experiments.

* Attack: batch_run_4o, batch_run_35, batch_run_37

* w/o Attack: batch_run_wo_atk_4o, batch_run_wo_atk_35, batch_run_wo_atk_37

* baselines: batch_run_benign, batch_run_inject, batch_run_spec, batch_run_virus

* enhance: batch_run_enhance_4o, batch_run_enhance_37

* ablation: batch_run_ablation


For defense experiments, run `cd defense/vwa_defense` and `pip install -e .`, then edit code follow [DEFENSE CHANGE](#defense-change), then run `batch_defense*.sh`.

For intent specualte, run `cd probe` and `batch_speculate.sh`, but we have put result in `ad_server/enhance.py`
